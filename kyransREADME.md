Week 2 , Lession one.

One of the Best things I have learnt today would have to be some of the history behind JavaScript that ive never looked into or thought about , giving a little more contrast to one of the most widely used languages around , this was quit refreshing to the normal daily task of comprehending new information. 
I and im assuming a few others was not aware of some of this history along with the use of debugging and testing new fonts and styles in the browser me and other people have also learnt important foundational skills such as simple variable setting and console logging.

Outside of the actual code, todays point amongst other things consist of and are not limited to , the use of the vs code program , a better understanding of language syntax and broader idea of general compiling with node. 

PS: todays lession went quite well I think largely to the fact when we moved to a new step it was made sure that most people were on that given step before moving onward it makes everything more cleaner and I noticed more productivity today , just thought I would note it seemed to be quite synergetic in the class.

Kicking off this lession with some pair coding having one driver to write the code and a passanger to navigate. this can be very benifitial for both participants because having to talk through problams paired with constant discussion to keep it fresh in your mind and remind you of what your task and focus is. This is also a very good way to fill in any gaps in knowledge because what you don’t know your partner may.
Getting back to some repository work also keeps recent work fresh and better to keep the things we have recently worked like having two people work in one repository and share the git commit and pull functions.

The work of mathematic operators is also a baseline for any obvious next step on creating a knowledgebase on basic javascript and the struggle of adding in the algebraic concepts  and as javascript knows it as grouping operator.
I struggled with some of the sytax to begin and wrapping your brain around stuff like this again makes remembering it a lot easier as if you don’t struggle every now and then you ease into a more forgetful state .

All up setting new variables and assignment operators hearing more about API’s and the difference between let/var/const is also nice and finishing with heavily marking the line in the sand between a global and local scope something that for me and my background I have sometimes struggled with. Not as vanilla as this explanation but I think you may get the picture.

I can say from experience most of everything today has real work implications mostly with the use of typescript setting variables is something you do on every single development task and every day is needed.
